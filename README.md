## Run Caramel CLI

Make sure you have two terminals open, and run this code in one of them:

```bash
  git clone repo_url
  cd team-1
  cd cli
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

Then, you can link the CLI to your system from another terminal:
```bash
  npm run link-cli
```

Finally, you should be able to use Caramel:
```bash
  caramel log <myour_message>
```
